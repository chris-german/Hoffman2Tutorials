    "\n",
    "A computer cluster is a set of connected computers (nodes) that work together under one system. Each node will have its own instance of an operating system and hardware. Clusters are used for high-performace distributed computing tasks. They are ideal for multilevel simulations and large-scale computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hoffman2 Cluster is a group of computing nodes that consists of over 1,200 64-bit nodes and 13,340 cores. It has an aggergate of over 50TB of memory. It consists of login nodes and compute nodes. Login nodes are where you can organize data (install packages, arrange data) and submit jobs and compute nodes are where computer-intensive tasks are run."
