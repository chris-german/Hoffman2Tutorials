# Hoffman2 Tutorials for Biostatisticians

This is a guide for using UCLA IDRE's Hoffman2 cluster computing system. There are guides for running jobs specific to [R](https://github.com/chris-german/Hoffman2Tutorials/tree/master/RTutorial) and [Julia](https://github.com/chris-german/Hoffman2Tutorials/tree/master/JuliaTutorial), as well as general guides for commands and what is available for users. 

To try out the sample code in the tutorial, simply issue 
```{bash,eval=F}
git clone https://github.com/chris-german/Hoffman2Tutorials.git
```
on Hoffman2 to clone this repository.

This document is mainly compiled by Chris German and Hua Zhou, with valuable input from Alec Chan-Goldston and Lu Zhang. If you want to contribute to this tutorial, work on the RMarkdown files `README.Rmd`, `RTutorial/R_Hoffman2.Rmd`, and `JuliaTutorial/Julia_Hoffman2.Rmd`, which can be knitted into the corresponding `README.md` files, and make pull requests.

## What is Hoffman2

A computer cluster is a set of connected computers (nodes) that work together under one system. Each node has its own instance of an operating system and hardware. Clusters are used for high-performace distributed computing tasks. They are ideal for multilevel simulations and large-scale computations.

The Hoffman2 Cluster is a group of computing nodes that consists of over 1,200 64-bit nodes and 13,340 cores. It has an aggergate of over 50TB of memory. It consists of **login nodes** and **compute nodes**. Login nodes are where you can organize data (install packages, arrange data) and submit jobs and compute nodes are where computer-intensive tasks are run.

## Account Creation

The first step is to create an account.

Register for an account at <https://www.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/getting-started/#newuser>.

For faculty sponsor, you can choose your advisor if (s)he is on the list. If you do not have an advisor yet or (s)he is not on list, you can choose `Hua Zhou` or `Sudipto Banerjee`. The faculty sponsor will receive an email after you submit the registration form. Once your account gets approved, you’ll get an email with a link to see your temporary password that must be used within 4 weeks.

## Logging in 

To login, go to terminal in Linux/MacOS and type:
```{bash,eval=F}
ssh username@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu 
```  
and enter your password when prompted. You can also set up the more secure SSH keys and no password is required, following <https://www.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/access/passwordless_ssh/>. 

Upon login, you see a welcome message:

Windows users can use PuTTY, MobaXterm, Cygwin, or Git Bash programs to establish SSH connection to Hoffman2. See <https://www.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/access/#Windows> for details.

## Basic Linux Commands

To use Hoffman2, which runs on CentOS 6 (a specific Linux distribution), you have to use linux/unix commands to navigate.

Some most useful commands:  

  * make a directory: `mkdir dirname `  
  * go to home directory: `cd`  
  * go to a certain directory: `cd /path/ `  
  * see current directory: `pwd`  
  * remove a file: `rm filename`  
  * remove a directory: `rm -r dirname`  
  * see whats in current directory: `ls`  
  * see whats in current directory (including hidden items): `ls -a`  
  * see size of current directory: `du -h`  
  * transfer files between cluster/local computer via ssh: `scp` (more on this later) 
  * to go to directory containing the current directory: `cd ..`

You can learn more about Linux in Dr. Hua Zhou's [Biostat 203B: Introduction to Data Science](https://ucla-biostat203b-2020winter.github.io/schedule.html) course.

## Available Software

You can query available software on Hoffman2 by   
```{bash, eval=F}
module avail
```
<img src="JuliaTutorial/pngs/Moduleavail.png" width="500">

More than the ones shown are available. It's a very long list. Most relevant to biostatisticians include R, Julia, Python, JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler), Matlab, and Stata. 

To see available modules that begin with a specific phrase, such as those that start with `julia`, type  
``` {bash, eval=F}
module avail julia
```  
<img src="JuliaTutorial/pngs/modavailjulia.png" width="500">

## Loading Software

To load a module, say `julia` version 1.1.0, for use type:
```{bash, eval=F}
module load julia/1.1.0
```
If you are going to need packages installed for your use on Hoffman2, load julia using `julia` and then install the packges. Note: This should be done on a compute node as compiling julia and libraries can take quite a bit of resources. Therefore, you should use `qrsh`, discussed later to do this. **Computing power is limited on login nodes so you should not run any analyses on the login node.**

## Transfering Files

### scp

`scp`, standing for secure copy paste, allows you to transfer files between an ssh server and your local computer. It's a useful command if you set up ssh keys so that you don't have to enter your password every time you want to transfer files.

To use `scp`:

  * go to directory you want to store things/send things in/from on local computer.
  * To send a file from local to cluster :
    + `scp filename.extension username@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu:∼/directory_to_save_in/`
  * To send multiple files from local to cluster
    + `scp filename1.extension filename2.extension username@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu:∼/directory_to_save_in/`
  * To send a file from cluster to local
    + `scp username@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu:∼/directory_its_in/filename.extension .`
  * To send multiple files from cluster to local 
    + `scp username@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu:∼/directory_its_in/{filename1.extension,filename2.extension} . `
  * To send directory with all files from cluster to local
    + `scp -r username@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu:∼/directory_to_send .`
    
    
### Globus 

Globus allows you to transfer files between your local computer and the cluster. To use Globus you will have to go to [www.globus.com](www.globus.com) and login through UCLA by selecting your existing organizational login as UCLA. 
Then you will need to download their Globus Connect Personal software, then set your laptop as an endpoint.

Very detailed instructions can be found here <https://www.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/file-transfer/globus/>

In short, login to globus, then under endpoints, select `Create new endpoint`.
Select a Globus Personal connect, then enter a name. Generate an installation setup key, save it somewhere, and then download the client. 
Once you launch the client, enter the setup key and you will have created an endpoint where you can transfer files to. 

From there, you can login to [globus.com](globus.com) or launch Globus Connect Personal and click files transfer. There you can choose to transfer files between your machine and the cluster. To find the endpoint to transfer files to/from on the server, search "Hoffman2" in the Collection bar of the File Manager and select one of the official UCLA Hoffman2 Data Transfer Nodes.

### Git and SVN

Hoffman2 has Git and svn available, which offer a more productive and reproducible way to synchornize source code between computers and platforms. For example, to get a copy of these tutorials, simply type  
```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/chris-german/Hoffman2Tutorials.git
```

## Submit Jobs to Hoffman2

Hoffman2 uses the UGE (Univa Grid Engine) job schedular to manage computing jobs on the cluster. See <https://www.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/computing/sge/> for some commonly used UGE commands or the more exhaustive [UGE User Guide](http://www.univa.com/resources/files/univa_user_guide_univa__grid_engine_854.pdf). Following examples are more specific to biostatistical applications.

### Submit a batch job by `qsub`

For most analyses/jobs, you should use the `qsub` command. This submits a batch job to the queue (scheduler). The type of file you `qsub` has to have a specific format (shell script). For example, following sample script [`submit.sh`](./RTutorial/submit.sh), with line-by-line comment, submits an R job. 
```{bash}
cat RTutorial/submit.sh
```
To send this script to the scheduler to run on a compute node, you would simply type:  
```{bash, eval=F}
qsub submit.sh
```  
In the detailed [R](./RTutorial/README.md) and [Julia](./JuliaTutorial/README.md) tutorials, we demonstrate how to generate such scripts systematically in a typical simulation study and submit them to potentially many compute nodes.

### Interactive session by `qrsh`

For some analyses, you may want to do things interactively instead of just submitting jobs. The `qrsh` command is for loading you onto an interactive compute node. 

Typing `qrsh` on the Hoffman2 login node will request an interactive session. By default, the session will run for two hours and the physical memory alotted will be 1GB. To request more, you can use the commmand
```{bash,eval=F}
qrsh -l h_rt=4:00:00,h_data=4G
```  
This will request a four hour session where the maximum physical memory is 4GB.

If you'd like to use more than one CPU core for your job, add `-pe shared #` to the end. Note, the amount of memory requested will be for each core. For example, if you'd like to request 4 CPU cores, each with 2GB of memory for a total of 8GB for 5 hours, run:
```{bash,eval=F}
qrsh -l h_rt=5:00:00,h_data=2G -pe shared 4
```
The more time and memory you request, the longer you will have to wait for an interactive compute node to become available to you. It's normal to wait a few minutes to get an interactive session. 

For more advanced options you can use                            
```{bash, eval=F}
qrsh -help
```

### Resource limitations

The maximum time for a session is 24 hours unless you're working in a group that owns their compute nodes. So do not have an `h_rt` value greater than `h_rt=24:00:00`.

Different compute nodes have different amounts of memory. There are fewer nodes with lots of memory, so the larger the amount of memory you're requesting the longer you will have to wait for the job to start running. If you request too much, the job may never run. 

Requesting more than 4 cores for an interactive session can possibly take a long time for the interactive session to start. 

### Canceling a job 

To cancel a job that is running or in the queue `qdel` is the command, use `myjob` to determine the job ID 
and then type:
```
qdel -u yourusername jobID
```
and the job will be canceled. To cancel all jobs simply leave `jobID` blank. 

## Using Jupyter Notebook

To use Jupyter Notebook interactively in Hoffman2, follow the instructions at <https://www.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/access/jupyter-notebook/>.

Note, to use Julia in Jupyter notebook, you will need to make sure you have installed the `IJulia` package in the version of julia that you would like to use. To use `julia v1.1.0`, login to Hoffman2, use the `qrsh` command to get an interactive compute note, then load julia 1.1.0, and launch julia and install the `IJulia` package.

## Data Storage

Users have access to three types of data storage on Hoffman2: group space, scratch space, and user home space. 

- Group space is available if you are in a group that purchased space through Hoffman2. 

- Scratch space allows you to store up to 1TB of data on the cluster, accessable by `$SCRATCH`. i.e. `cd $SCRATCH`. This is meant for temporary storage only, and files are only guaranteed to stay on the space for 7 days. After, they are erased. 

- User home space is 20GB of data. This is where you can store files permanently. 

To check your storage usage and availability, use the command `myquota`. 

## Biostatistics Specific Nodes

If you are a biostatistics doctoral student, there are compute nodes that the biostatistics department has which will allow you to run jobs longer than 24 hours (up to 14 days). These nodes give group users priority to use them, so a job is guaranteed to run within 24 hours of the job submission on these nodes unless they're all being used by other biostatistics group members. To get membership for these nodes, you will need to select Dr. Hua Zhou or Dr. Sudipto Banerjee as faculty sponsor. 

The biostatistics nodes are under the group name `@sudipto_pod`. To view the list of biostatistics nodes you can run the command  
```{bash, eval=F}
qconf -shgrp @sudipto_pod
```
with example output  
```
group_name @sudipto_pod
hostlist n6277 n7277 n6278 n7278 n6285 n7285 n6643 n7643
```

To see what types of nodes there are (how many cores and how much memory each node has) you can run   
```{bash, eval=F}
qhost -h n6277 n7277 n6278 n7278 n6285 n7285 n6444 n7405
```
with output   
```

n7278                   intel-X5650    12    2   12   12  0.25   47.3G    6.8G   15.3G   65.7M

```

This shows that the biostatistics group has six nodes (n6277 n6278 n6285 n7277 n7278 n7285), each with 12 cores and 48GB of memeory (an average of 4GB/core), and two nodes (n6643 n7643), each with 36 cores and 192GB of memory (an average of 5.3GB/core).

## Request Biostatistics Nodes

To request these nodes specifically, include `-l highp` when requesting the job.

For example, the line in your `.sh` file should look like:
```
-l h_data=1G,h_rt=48:00:00,highp
```

To alter (without re-submitting it) a already-pending job from non-highp to highp, follow steps:

1. Get the “hard resource” parameter list:  
    ```{bas,eval=F}
    qstat -j job_id | grep ^'hard resource_list'
    ```
For example, you have hard resource_list: `h_data=1024M,h_rt=259200`
You will use the list beyond the colon (“:”) in the “hard resource_list” output above in the next step.

2. Add the highp option to the hard resource_list using the qaltercommand:
`qalter -l h_data=1024M,h_rt=259200,highp job_id`, where job_id is replaced by the actual job ID (number). For more information about `qalter`, try the command: `man qalter`.
