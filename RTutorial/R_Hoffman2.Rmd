# Hoffman2 R Tutorial

For basic information on Hoffman2, including submitting jobs, check job status, resources available, transfering files, and other general information, refer to the general guide <https://github.com/chris-german/Hoffman2Tutorials>.

## Available R Versions

There are several versions of R on the cluster, with more up-to-date ones being installed as they are released and requested. 
```{bash, eval=F}
module avail R
```
![](pngs/ModuleavailR.png){width=70%}


## Loading Software

To load a module, say R version 4.0.2, for use type:
```{bash, eval=F}
module load R/4.0.2
```

If you are going to need packages installed for your use on Hoffman2, load R using `R` and then install the packges. Note: This will be on the login node, where computing power is limited so you should not run any analyses on this node. Instead, you run analyses on a compute node. 

## Accessing a compute node

### qsub

For most analyses/jobs you'd like to run on Hoffman2, you should use the `qsub` command. This submits a batch job to the queue (scheduler). The type of file you `qsub` has to have a specific format (batch script).
```{bash}
cat submit.sh
```
To send this script to the scheduler to run on a compute node, you would simply type:
```{bash, eval = F}
qsub submit.sh
```

### qrsh

For some analyses, you may want to do things interactively instead of just submitting jobs. The `qrsh` command is for loading you onto an interactive compute node. 

Typing `qrsh` on the Hoffman2 login node will submit a request for an interactive session. By default, the session will run for two hours and the physical memory alotted will be 1GB.

To request more, you can use the commmand
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
qrsh -l h_rt=4:00:00,h_data=4G
```

This will request a four hour session where the maximum physical memory is 4GB. 
If you'd like to use more than one CPU core for your job, add `-pe shared #` to the end. Note, the amount of memory requested will be for each core. For example, if you'd like to request 4 CPU cores, each with 2GB of memory for a total of 8GB for 5 hours, run:
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
qrsh -l h_rt=5:00:00,h_data=2G -pe shared 4
```
The more time and memory you request, the longer you will have to wait for an interactive compute node to become available to you. It's normal to wait a few minutes to get an interactive session. 

### R.q

In addition to submitting a shell script via `qsub`, for R, there is the command `R.q` that can be used to generate a shell `.sh` script for an `Rscript` file and submit the job. Simply upload a `.R` file that you want to run on the cluster and type `R.q`. Follow the prompts and it will run the `.R` file with the apporpriate options you select.

## Resource limitations

The maximum time for a session is 24 hours unless you're working in a group that owns their compute nodes. So do not have an `h_rt` value greated than `h_rt=24:00:00`.

Different compute nodes have different amounts of memory. There are fewer nodes with lots of memory, so the larger the amount of memory you're requesting the longer you will have to wait for the job to start running. If you request too much, the job may never run. 

Requesting more than 4 cores for an interactive session can possibly take a long time for the interactive session to start. 

## Using RStudio Server on Hoffman2

To use RStudio on Hoffman2, the recommended way is through RStudio Server running on a compute node. To do so, you will have to launch an interactive session via `qrsh` and then run Rstudio Server inside [Apptainer](https://www.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/Using-H2/Software/Software.html#apptainer), an operating system virtualization program. 

1. Inside the cluster command line, run:

```bash
# get an interactive job
qrsh -l h_data=5G
# Create small tmp directories for RStudio to write into
mkdir -pv $SCRATCH/rstudiotmp/var/lib
mkdir -pv $SCRATCH/rstudiotmp/var/run
mkdir -pv $SCRATCH/rstudiotmp/tmp
#Setup apptainer
module load apptainer/1.0.0
#Run rstudio
apptainer run -B $SCRATCH/rstudiotmp/var/lib:/var/lib/rstudio-server -B $SCRATCH/rstudiotmp/var/run:/var/run/rstudio-server -B $SCRATCH/rstudiotmp/tmp:/tmp $H2_CONTAINER_LOC/h2-rstudio_4.1.0.sif
# This command will display some information and a `ssh -L ...` command for you to run on a separate terminal 
```

After the `apptainer` command you will be prompted with information regarding the version of R and Rstudio, the node where the Rstudio session is running and the port through which the application is listening. There will also be three lines of instructing you on how to initiate an SSH tunnel on your local computer in order to be able to connect with your local browser to the Rstudio session running remotely on the cluster compute node. These instructions are relevant for the next steps and are highlighted in the sample output of the `apptainer` command:

```
$ apptainer run -B $SCRATCH/rstudiotmp/var/lib:/var/lib/rstudio-server -B $SCRATCH/rstudiotmp/var/run:/var/run/rstudio-server -B $SCRATCH/rstudiotmp/tmp:/tmp $H2_CONTAINER_LOC/h2-rstudio_4.1.0.sif
INFO:    Converting SIF file to temporary sandbox...


This is the Rstudio server container running R 4.1.0 from Rocker

This is a separate R version from the rest of Hoffman2
When you install libraries from this Rstudio/R, they will be in ~/R/APPTAINER/h2-rstudio_4.1.0

Your Rstudio server is running on:  n7677
It is running on PORT:  8787

Open a SSH tunnel on your local computer by running:
 ssh -N -L 8787:nXXXX:8787 joebruin@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu

Then open your web browser to  http://localhost:8787
```

where `nXXXX` will be the name of the actual compute node where the Rstudio session is running and `joebruin` will be your Hoffman2 Cluster User ID. Make note of these instructions as they will be needed in the next step of the setup.


2. Open a new terminal on your _local_ machine, and initiate SSH tunnel using the command shown in the previous step: 

```bash
ssh -N -L 8787:nXXXX:8787 joebruin@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu
```

where `nXXXX` will be the name of the compute node where the Rstudio session is running and `joebruin` will be your Hoffman2 Cluster User ID. After issuing the command you will be prompted for your password and, if the SSH tunnel is successful the prompt will not return on this terminal. This needs the `ssh` program (e.g. OpenSSH) accessible on the terminal of your local machine.

After this, connections to port 8787 of your local machine is forwarded to the port 8787 of the remote machine (node `nXXXX` of Hoffman2). This will allow you to access the RStudio running on a compute node of Hoffman2 by typing `http://localhost:8787` on your web browser.

## A single simulation run

The sample R script [`runSim.R`](./runSim.R) runs a simulation study to compare two methods for estimating mean: `est_mean_prime` and `est_mean_avg`. In each replicate, it generates a random vector of sample size `n`, from distribution `d`, and using seed `s`. There are `reps` replicates. Values of `n`, `d`, `s` `reps` are defined by command-line arguments.
```{bash}
cat runSim.R
```

To run this simulation from command line, user needs pass value for `n`, `reps`, `s`, and `d` via command-line argument. For example,
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
module load R
Rscript runSim.R 100 100 123 rnorm(n)
# command-line arguments: number of samples, number of repetitions, seed, command to create n samples
```
But remember we should not run this job on the login node. We submit it to a compute node using the script [`submit.sh`](./submit.sh)
```{bash, eval=F}
qsub submit.sh
```

After the job is done, we can examine that the results have been written to the txt file.
```{bash}
head simresults/n_100d_rnorm\(n\).txt 
```
If you experience an error, you can take a look at the `output.####` file that was generated. This files indicates any output generated in R. 

## Multiple simulation runs

In a typical simulation study, we vary the values of different simulation factors such as sample size, generative model, effect size, and so on. We can write a job script with jobarray setup to manage multiple simulations. It's easy to set up and perform embarrasingly parallel simulation tasks.

The syntax depends on the scheduling system. On UCLA's Hoffman2 cluster, `qsub` is used. In [`submit_array.sh`](./submit_array.sh), we loop over sample sizes `n` (100, 200, ..., 500). [`run_arrays.sh`](./run_arrays.sh) contains commands to submit multiple arrays with different generative models (standard normal, T distribution with 5 degree of freedom, and T distribution with 1 degree of freedom).
```{bash}
cat submit_array.sh
```

```{bash}
cat run_arrays.sh
```

So on the cluster we just need to run
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
bash run_arrays.sh
```

You can check on the state of your current jobs by running:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
myjob
```
<!--![](pngs/Myjob.png){width=550px}-->

To check the output files generated after the jobs have run.
```{bash}
ls simresults/*.txt
```
