# Hoffman2 R Tutorial

For basic information on Hoffman2, including submitting jobs, check job status, resources available, transfering files, and other general information, refer to the general guide <https://github.com/chris-german/Hoffman2Tutorials>.

## Available R Versions

There are several versions of R on the cluster, with more up-to-date ones being installed as they are released and requested. 
```{bash, eval=F}
module avail R
```
![](pngs/ModuleavailR.png){width=70%}


## Loading Software

To load a module, say R version 4.0.2, for use type:
```{bash, eval=F}
module load R/4.0.2
```

If you are going to need packages installed for your use on Hoffman2, load R using `R` and then install the packges. Note: This will be on the login node, where computing power is limited so you should not run any analyses on this node. Instead, you run analyses on a compute node. 

## Accessing a compute node

### qsub

For most analyses/jobs you'd like to run on Hoffman2, you should use the `qsub` command. This submits a batch job to the queue (scheduler). The type of file you `qsub` has to have a specific format (batch script).
```{bash}
cat submit.sh
```
To send this script to the scheduler to run on a compute node, you would simply type:
```{bash, eval = F}
qsub submit.sh
```

### qrsh

For some analyses, you may want to do things interactively instead of just submitting jobs. The `qrsh` command is for loading you onto an interactive compute node. 

Typing `qrsh` on the Hoffman2 login node will submit a request for an interactive session. By default, the session will run for two hours and the physical memory alotted will be 1GB.

To request more, you can use the commmand
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
qrsh -l h_rt=4:00:00,h_data=4G
```

This will request a four hour session where the maximum physical memory is 4GB. 
If you'd like to use more than one CPU core for your job, add `-pe shared #` to the end. Note, the amount of memory requested will be for each core. For example, if you'd like to request 4 CPU cores, each with 2GB of memory for a total of 8GB for 5 hours, run:
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
qrsh -l h_rt=5:00:00,h_data=2G -pe shared 4
```
The more time and memory you request, the longer you will have to wait for an interactive compute node to become available to you. It's normal to wait a few minutes to get an interactive session. 

### R.q

In addition to submitting a shell script via `qsub`, for R, there is the command `R.q` that can be used to generate a shell `.sh` script for an `Rscript` file and submit the job. Simply upload a `.R` file that you want to run on the cluster and type `R.q`. Follow the prompts and it will run the `.R` file with the apporpriate options you select.

## Resource limitations

The maximum time for a session is 24 hours unless you're working in a group that owns their compute nodes. So do not have an `h_rt` value greated than `h_rt=24:00:00`.

Different compute nodes have different amounts of memory. There are fewer nodes with lots of memory, so the larger the amount of memory you're requesting the longer you will have to wait for the job to start running. If you request too much, the job may never run. 

Requesting more than 4 cores for an interactive session can possibly take a long time for the interactive session to start. 

## Using RStudio on Hoffman2

To use RStudio on Hoffman2, you must launch an interactive session via `qrsh` and then load the R studio module. Then you type `rstudio` and the RStudio IDE will launch. You may have to setup x11 forwarding, via this link <https://www.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/Using-H2/Connecting/Connecting.html#opening-gui-applications>. On a Mac, you will need to install XQuartz, run 
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 enable_iglx -bool true
```
in terminal and when logging into Hoffman2, type:
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
ssh -Y username@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu
```

If you get the warning message:
`Warning: No xauth data; using fake authentication data for X11 forwarding.`

You will need to setup a config file in your local machine's /.ssh/ path that specifies ForwardX11 yes.
On a Mac, you may also need to specify the XAuth location, for my computer I created the config file and added the following lines.  
```
Host hoffman2  
Hostname=hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu  
User=username  
XAuthLocation /opt/X11/bin/xauth  
ForwardAgent yes  
ForwardX11 yes  
ForwardX11Trusted yes  
```
This can be done on a mac via

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
nano ~/.ssh/config
```
Then typing the lines above, and pressing `control + O` to save then `enter` to save the name and then `control + X` to exit.

This sets up forwarding and also allows you to access the cluster as `username` by simply typing 
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ssh hoffman2
```

Then to access RStudio run the following:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
qrsh
module load R/4.0.2
module load Rstudio
rstudio
```

RStudio will launch in the application that you use for x11 forwarding and you can use it as you would RStudio on your own computer.

If you do not have a module of R loaded, Rstudio will load the current default version of R on the cluster unless you have an R module alredy loaded.

The version of Rstudio on Hoffman2 is quite old, some of the nodes have a more modern version of Rstudio. You can request an interactive session on these nodes specifically with the `-l rh7` option, such as:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
qrsh -l rh7
module load Rstudio
rstudio
```

## A single simulation run

The sample R script [`runSim.R`](./runSim.R) runs a simulation study to compare two methods for estimating mean: `est_mean_prime` and `est_mean_avg`. In each replicate, it generates a random vector of sample size `n`, from distribution `d`, and using seed `s`. There are `reps` replicates. Values of `n`, `d`, `s` `reps` are defined by command-line arguments.
```{bash}
cat runSim.R
```

To run this simulation from command line, user needs pass value for `n`, `reps`, `s`, and `d` via command-line argument. For example,
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
module load R
Rscript runSim.R 100 100 123 rnorm(n)
# command-line arguments: number of samples, number of repetitions, seed, command to create n samples
```
But remember we should not run this job on the login node. We submit it to a compute node using the script [`submit.sh`](./submit.sh)
```{bash, eval=F}
qsub submit.sh
```

After the job is done, we can examine that the results have been written to the txt file.
```{bash}
head simresults/n_100d_rnorm\(n\).txt 
```
If you experience an error, you can take a look at the `output.####` file that was generated. This files indicates any output generated in R. 

## Multiple simulation runs

In a typical simulation study, we vary the values of different simulation factors such as sample size, generative model, effect size, and so on. We can write a job script with jobarray setup to manage multiple simulations. It's easy to set up and perform embarrasingly parallel simulation tasks.

The syntax depends on the scheduling system. On UCLA's Hoffman2 cluster, `qsub` is used. In [`submit_array.sh`](./submit_array.sh), we loop over sample sizes `n` (100, 200, ..., 500). [`run_arrays.sh`](./run_arrays.sh) contains commands to submit multiple arrays with different generative models (standard normal, T distribution with 5 degree of freedom, and T distribution with 1 degree of freedom).
```{bash}
cat submit_array.sh
```

```{bash}
cat run_arrays.sh
```

So on the cluster we just need to run
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
bash run_arrays.sh
```

You can check on the state of your current jobs by running:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
myjob
```
<!--![](pngs/Myjob.png){width=550px}-->

To check the output files generated after the jobs have run.
```{bash}
ls simresults/*.txt
```
